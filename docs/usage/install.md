## Installation

1. Composer Dependency:

To leverage the functionalities offered by the `oscabrera/laravel-json-api-format-paginate` package in your Laravel
project, you'll need to install it using Composer, the dependency management tool for PHP. Open your terminal or command
prompt and navigate to your project's root directory. Then, execute the following command:

```shell
composer require oscabrera/laravel-json-api-format-paginate
```

This command instructs Composer to download the `oscabrera/laravel-json-api-format-paginate` package from the Packagist
repository and include it in your project's dependencies.
